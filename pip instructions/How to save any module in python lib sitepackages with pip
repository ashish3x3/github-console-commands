To store any module directly in python lib..don't just pip install anywhere..

go to python.exe resptly oif the version and then

A:\virtualEnvPython\python27>C:\Python27\python.exe -m pip install xlrd
this will install xlrd in python27.lib.sitepackages

and you don't need to refresh pycharm to update it..it will take it automatically..
