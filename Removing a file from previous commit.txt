Removing a file from previous commit:

if want to remove TestSkuidNewApplication.cls from a commit ,which was done by mistake
git rm --cached src\classes\TestSkuidNewApplication.cls

git commit -m "removed test class from commit"
git push origin  multi-currency-gd-462-hydra

this wil remove it from the tree in origin..

no we have to add it again fresh without any changes..

go to that file TestSkuidNewApplication.cls, roll/reset back to earlier version by coping from git,ect
commit that file again without any changes
git add src\classes\TestSkuidNewApplication.cls
git commit 
git push
