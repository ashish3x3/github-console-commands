You can just use

git config credential.helper store

When you enter password next time with pull or push it will be stored in .git-credentials as plain text (a bit unsecure, but just put it to protected folder)

And that's it, as stated on this page:

https://git-scm.com/docs/git-credential-store

If you want Git to resume to asking you for credentials every time it needs to connect to the remote repository, you can run this command:

git config --unset credential.helper
To store the passwords in .git-credentials in your %HOME% directory as opposed to the project directory: use the --global flag

git config --global credential.helper store
