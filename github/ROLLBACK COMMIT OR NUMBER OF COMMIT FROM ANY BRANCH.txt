If you have been making commits on your main branch while you coded, but you now want to move those commits to a different branch:

Create a new branch with the same HEAD as current, and switch to it:
git checkout -b new-feature-branch
Now force the original "messy" branch to roll back, without switching to it:

$ git branch -f messy-branch commit-id
For example:

$ git branch -f master origin/master
or if you have made 4 commits:
$ git branch -f master HEAD~4
