To remove a local branch from your machine:

git branch -d the_local_branch

To remove a remote branch from the server:

git push origin :the_remote_branch



As of Git v1.7.0, you can delete a remote branch using

git push origin --delete <branchName>
which is easier to remember than

git push origin :<branchName>
which was added in Git v1.5.0 "to delete a remote branch or a tag."



You can also use the following to delete the remote branch.

git push --delete origin serverfix
Which does the same thing as

git push origin :serverfix
but it may be easier to remember.
