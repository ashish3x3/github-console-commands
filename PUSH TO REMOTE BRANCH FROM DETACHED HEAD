SO YOU messed up something and though of reverting to old nice commit...

you  did git reflog took the hash of nice commit

and git checkout hashof commit

but now if you do git branch you will see ..
A:\CLO_Branch_Org\Genesis-Main>git branch
* (HEAD detached from ccf39bc)
  Ashish_Vela_RC1
  master


  so you cannot just write git push origin branch-name bcz of two reason one bcz U are not on any branch rigth now second your remote tip is ahead then your nice commit..so it throws error.. Updates were rejected because a pushed branch tip is behind its remote..


  In this case you have to do do 2 things..
  first your synatcx for push will change to 

  git push -f origin HEAD:name-of-your-branch
  HEAD will reame as it is..no renaming

  -f to force changes bcz your head is behind remote head,so force git to do wht you are saying..

  done..


  Also what this will do is remove your history from remote untill nice commit hash... in a way remove alllater commits after nice commit to start afresh after this commit agian..



  Pulling recent changes to a branch from remote after above steps

  Now we need to update our branch to remote branch head..

  checkout to brach..git checkout branch-name...you may need to do git stash before moving

  git pull origin other-branch

Git is basically doing this: git fetch origin other-branch && git merge other-branch

now your local brach is up to date woth remote branch
