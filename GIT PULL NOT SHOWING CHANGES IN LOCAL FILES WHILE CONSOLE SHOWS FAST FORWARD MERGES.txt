GIT PULL ORIGIN originae_rc_branch

shows fastforward merges and succesful adding of new lines to files but local file does not change... and doing gitpull again shows branch up to date..

2 ways..
1. make this branch as consotent wiht hte remote branch
-- checkout to new  branch
-- do   git reflog..and checkout to head befor U made pull request
-- do pull request again...


if still dodn'y show changes..

--do git stash... done..now it should display changes locally..
